# Model code
The file `model_code_paper.ipynb` presents the code used to train the 3 models in the paper:

* the baseline model,
* the demographic model, (enriched with demographic information, presented as a binary vector)
* the encoded demographic model (enriched with demographic information, presented as an encoded dense vector)

The autoencoder used to encode the demographic vectors is also presented in this file.

Please refer to section 4 of the paper for a more elaborate description of the models.
