# Model code
The file `model_code_paper.ipynb` presents the code used in the paper:
*On Text Classification Using a Rich Set of Demographic Features: Evidences for Sustainable Project Planning in Rural Communities*

In particular, we include the code use to train the following three models:
* the baseline model,
* the demographic model, (enriched with demographic information, presented as a binary vector)
* the encoded demographic model (enriched with demographic information, presented as an encoded dense vector)

The code for the autoencoder used to encode the demographic vectors is also included in this file.

Please refer to Section 4 of the paper for a more elaborate description of the models. 

Thank you for your time and efforts to review our paper.
